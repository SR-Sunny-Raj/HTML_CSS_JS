      Swaminarayan Akshardham is a Hindu temple, and spiritual-cultural campus
      in Delhi, India. The temple is close to the border with Noida. Also
      referred to as Akshardham Temple or Akshardham Delhi, the complex displays
      millennia of traditional and modern Hindu culture, spirituality, and
      architecture. Inspired by Yogiji Maharaj and created by Pramukh Swami
      Maharaj, it was constructed by BAPS.The temple was officially opened on 6
      November 2005 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in the presence of Dr. A. P. J.
      Abdul Kalam, Manmohan Singh, L.K Advani and B.L Joshi.The temple, at the
      centre of the complex, was built according to the Vastu shastra and
      Pancharatra shastra. In Swaminarayan Akshardham, similar to its
      predecessor Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, the main
      shrine is the focal point and maintains the central position of the entire
      complex. There are various exhibition halls which provide information
      about the life and work of Swaminarayan.The designers of the complex have
      adopted contemporary modes of communication and technology to create the
      various exhibition halls.The complex features an abhishek mandap, Sahaj
      Anand water show, a thematic garden, and three exhibitions namely
      Sahajanand Darshan (Hall of Values), Neelkanth Darshan (an IMAX film on
      the early life of Swaminarayan as the teenage yogi, Neelkanth), and
      Sanskruti Darshan (cultural boat ride). According to Swaminarayan
      Hinduism, the word Akshardham means the abode of Swaminarayan and believed
      by followers as a temporal home of God on earth
