      The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship
      that was dedicated in December 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it
      has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Houses of Worship,
      the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other
      qualification. According to Shoghi Effendi, a Bahá'í temple is a “silent
      teacher” of the Bahá'í faith.The building is composed of 27 free-standing
      marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,with
      nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34
      meters and a capacity of 1,300 people.The Lotus Temple has won numerous
      architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine
      articles. The temple was dedicated 23–27 December 1986 with a gathering of
      8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including some 4,000 Baháʼís from 22
      provinces in India. On January 1 the temple was opened to the public and
      more than 10,000 people visited that first day.By late 2001, it had
      attracted more than 70 million visitors according to Manpreet Brar, a CNN
      reporter. The permanent delegation of India to UNESCO stated that the
      Lotus Temple has received over 100 million visitors by April 2014.
