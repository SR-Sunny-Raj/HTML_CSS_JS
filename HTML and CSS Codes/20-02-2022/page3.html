      Goa might be among India's smallest states, but it has a bounty of beaches
      that beat any other coastal areas of the subcontinent. Think: Swaying
      palms, uninterrupted stretches of glittery gold sand, and smooth azure
      surf that promises to soothe the stresses of traveling in India. And at
      just an hour and 15 minutes away by air from Mumbai, Goa is an easy
      holiday destination to add to any trip to South India. No matter what
      you're looking for, you can find coastal places to visit in Goa that suit
      your individual travel style. Benaulim Beach is a welcoming destination
      for families. Agonda Beach is the go-to place for wannabe surfers.
      Travelers who want to go off the beaten path will love discovering
      Butterfly Beach.

      <h3><u>Some of the famous beaches of Goa are</u> -:</h3>
      <h3>Colva Beach</h3>
      One of Goa's most famous beaches, Colva attracts crowds of tourists during high season (mid-November through mid-February) â€” for good reason. The 2.4-kilometer-long beach in south Goa offers an endless array of aquatic adventure sports (including jet skiing, banana boat rides, and parasailing), sand that's as soft and as white as baby powder, and a well-developed tourism infrastructure that can cater to your every need. See for yourself at the incredible beach resorts in this area.
Colva Beach is a favorite among Indian tourists, so if you're looking for a local experience, you'll find it here. Consider staying overnight at one of the many homestay accommodations offered by families in the village for an even more authentic trip.
When you've had enough sun, head just a few minutes inland for sanctuary at Our Lady of Mercy Church. The white-washed spiritual center in the village square was founded in the 1600s and houses a famous statue of an infant Jesus that reportedly has healing powers. The attraction draws countless pilgrims from around the world for the traditional Fama celebration every October.
<h3>Dona Paula Beach</h3>
Dona Paula Beach is one of the best beaches in Goa for honeymoon tourists. Nicknamed "Lovers' Paradise," this coastal destination in the suburbs of Panaji even has its own love legend.

The tale is about Dona Paula, the daughter of a Portuguese viceroy, who threw herself into the Arabian Sea after her father forbade her from seeing a Goan fisherman who had stolen her heart. The viceroy was so saddened by the loss of his young daughter that he named this entire beautiful area after her, and treated it as a tribute to eternal romance.

It's easy for modern-day tourists to fall in love with this pretty beach. It's got calm waters and bronze sand shaded by palm trees, along with a relaxing vibe that begs you to stick around for sunset. It's also well served by a range of accommodations, including boutique hotels and luxury beach resorts, that will make you feel right at home.
<h3>Morjim Beach</h3>
This beach in north Goa offers a more wild, rustic feel than others in the state. It's a tranquil escape, lined with beach huts and sun beds, where you can spend hours on end. Morjim Beach has earned the nickname "Little Russia" for the large influx of Russians who stay here for weeks at a time. Its abundance of Russian restaurants can be a welcome change of pace from the rest of the food in Goa.

One of the top things to do in Morjim Beach is check out the wildlife. A variety of feathered species, including kingfishers, cuckoos, bay-backed shrikes, and sand plovers, create a bird-lovers' utopia. Olive ridley sea turtles can be found along the beach and offer unique photo opportunities. However, local laws prohibit tourists from disturbing the creatures, so be respectful and avoid getting too close. Look out to sea and you may see dolphins swimming along the horizon.
